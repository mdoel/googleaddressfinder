Before Next Release:

* Improve algorithm for getting addresses.  The current implementation uses the standard Google Maps web interface to get addresses.  This could likely be improved by using the official Google Maps API.

* More intelligent limiting.  Instead of relying on :max_hits_per_location, the library should auto-limit based on Google results.

* Allow loading addresses from cached file instead of going out to Google
